# Thames River Anglers Association: Site Redesign
### Mike Prior and Scott Olthoff
This final project is a continuation of the midterm project. The goal of the midterm was to redesign, code and semantically tag, a static, 6 page, HTML5 website for the Thames River Anglers Association. 

For this part of the project, we must make the site we created for the midterm responsive so it can be used on different devices. We must also implement a video, a slideshow, and one other JavaScript element.
