					<!-- Description -->
					<p>This spring's hatch of rainbow trout was incredibly successful with low mortality resulting in a phenomenal total of over 40,000 fry ready for release day on Saturday June 21, 2014.</p>

					<p>TRAA members and guests met at the Country Hearth Restaurant in Komoka and car-pooled to the TRAA hatchery site to help out moving the fry from the hatchery to the TRAA transfer tank.</p>

					<p>The rainbow trout fry were released into Dingman Creek.</p>

					<p>A big THANK YOU goes out to everyone on the trout hatchery rotation whose dedication ensured a visit every day of the week from the fall when we got the brown trout and the brook trout eggs, through the winter and into the spring when we got the rainbow trout eggs.</p>

					<p>Thanks also go out to Chris Coligan volunteering his pickup truck to transport the transfer tank to the release site.</p>

					<p>The fry have been getting fat and strong in the hatchery growth tank. The spray bar seen at the back of the picture creates a simulated current. They are hand netted from the tank and placed in buckets to make the trip up the hill to the waiting transfer tank.</p>

					<p>Once the fry have been netted from the growth tank into the buckets, it's time for the arduous trip up the stairs from the hatchery to where the transfer tank awaits.</p>

					<p>The fry travel in the transfer tank in the back of a pickup truck to the release site which in this case is this pretty section of Dingman Creek. This image shows three volunteers "acclimating" the water in the bags with that of the creek to minimize the shock of temperature change upon the release of the trout fry.</p>

					<p>The recently released rainbow trout fry quickly adjust to their new home in the wild. It's difficult to say how many of these guys will make it to adulthood but we know that thanks to the TRAA and their dedicated Trout Committee, they'll at least get a head start.</p>
